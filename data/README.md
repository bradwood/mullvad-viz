Data files used by Mullvad Viz

Location: data/

Files
- relays.json
  - Canonical data file consumed by the frontend at `/api/relays`.
  - Contains an array of relay objects. See root README for the schema.

- city-coordinates.json
  - A helper lookup mapping city codes (short tokens like "cph", "hel"), short airport-like codes ("par", "sfo") and friendly names ("Copenhagen", "San Francisco") to { lat, lon } objects.
  - Used by `tools/fetch-relays.js` to resolve coordinates when the CLI output lacks explicit lat/lon.

- countries.json
  - Map of country codes to friendly country names. The ingestion script uses this to convert short codes to full country names.

Editing data
- relays.json is generated by tools/fetch-relays.js when run via `npm run ingest` (provided the Mullvad CLI is installed).
- To add missing city coordinates, either:
  - Edit `data/city-coordinates.json` directly (JSON) and add entries keyed by city code or friendly name, or
  - Run `npm run add-city` to add the predefined Tirana mapping.

Validation notes
- Ensure lat/lon values are valid decimal degrees. Avoid leaving lat/lon at 0/0 unless the location genuinely is at that point.
- If you plan to edit relays.json by hand, adhere to the schema in the root README.
